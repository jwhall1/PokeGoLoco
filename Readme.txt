Run PokeGoLoco.py on your PC and go hunt pokemon!



text your gps coordinates to "pokegoloco@gmail.com" wrapped in ?s  (?xxxxxx.xxxxxxx?)

pokegoloco will call main.py with your current location, ping niantic server, then save results as "output.txt", then call sendtext.py

sendtext.py will text your phone the contents of "output.txt" from pokegoloco.
